# klervicn-resume
You can see this project running [here](http://nayru.fr)
This is my first "real" project in Javascript/HTML/CSS

NB : This project needs refactor as I have evolved and I'm capable of producing a better code now.

## Stream tab
This tab is simply hosting my twitch channel with link to my social networks

## Blog tab
This tab is displaying blog posts written in Markdown and transformed into React JSX.

## Resume tab
This tab is displaying my resume, displayed with NextJS, with a translation function so you can also see it in english
